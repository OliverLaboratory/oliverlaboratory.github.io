    Principal Investigator <br>
    <i>Assistant Professor of Molecular Physiology and Biophysics</i><br>
    <i>Assistant Professor of Computer Science</i> <br><br>
    I obtained a PhD in Computer Science at McGill University under the supervision of 
    Jerome Waldispuhl and William Hamilton building geometric deep learning methods for pattern mining
    and drug discovery in RNA molecules. From 2021 to 2024, worked under Karsten Borgwardt at ETH Zurich and the Max Planck institute for Biochemistry developing deep learning approaches to study structure-function relationships in proteins. In 2025 I joined Vanderbilt University as a tenure-track assistant professor in the <a href="https://www.vanderbilt.edu/ai-proteindynamics/">Center for AI in Protein Dynamics</a> to continue studying structure-function maps and delve into the temporal dimension of biomolecular function.

    AI Engineer <br>
    I am currently a Masterâ€™s student in Data Science at Vanderbilt University, where I serve as Head Teaching Assistant for both the undergraduate data science course and the MBA Business Analytics course. In the fall of 2024, I contributed as an AI Engineer to a research initiative on binary black hole periodicity detection, using stochastic modeling and large language models. In parallel, I also worked as a Machine Learning Integration Consultant at Nissan, supporting the deployment of predictive analytics in production environments. I hold a Bachelor's degree in Economics from the International School of Economics at Tbilisi State University (ISET), where I graduated with distinction, with a strong emphasis on Econometrics and Statistical Modeling.
